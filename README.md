# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Shri

I'm a curious software developer who loves learning, building, and sharing along the way.  
Tech is my tool, but what really drives me is growth â€” in code, in thinking, and in life.

This repo is where I write and collect my articles, notes, and thoughts as I explore different areas of tech.  
Itâ€™s not perfect â€” just real, evolving, and 100% mine. ðŸŒ±

Think of it as my digital notebook â€” open to the world.
